# Installer no longer required on OSX

The installation process on OSX has been updated to no longer require an installer. Instead, LiveCode now installs like most other OSX applications: drag the app from the DMG to your Applications folder.

Similarly, there is no longer an uninstaller; drag the app to the Trash to remove.
