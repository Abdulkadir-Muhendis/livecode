# LiveCode Builder Language
## Lexical Scoping

* handler local variables are now lexically scoped. This means
  variables are accessible from the point of definition to the
  end of the block they are defined in.

* each repeat control structure is considered a single block.

* each separate block in an if/else if/else control structure
  is considered a single block.

* variables are reset (either to their default value, or
  unassigned) at the point of the variable definition. In
  particular, any variables defined within a repeat block are
  reset on each iteration:

   repeat 5 times
      variable tVar as optional String
      -- tVar is reset to "nothing" every time the loop runs
   end repeat

* variables in an inner block can now shadow those in an outer
  block. For example, the following is valid:

   variable tX as Array
   repeat 5 times
      variable tX as Number
      repeat 4 times
         variable tX as String
      end repeat
   end repeat

# [17526] Make variables lexically scoped in statement blocks.
