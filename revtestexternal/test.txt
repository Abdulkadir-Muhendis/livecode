however, to test on iOS
all you need to do
is build the revtestexternal target for the simulator you want to test on
make sure you have the 7.0 IDE running, along with a matching iOS simulator engine (built in the same repo)
then if you use the revtestexternal.livecode stack
make sure copyfiles pane has the binaries/revtestexternal.lcext file included
then when you do 'test' it should build / run in the simularot and include the external
you'll need to modify the testexternal stack so it calls stuff you want to test :)
there's a shell script 'build-android.sh'
in revtestexternal which should build the android external
