# Widget Theme

The theme of the navigation bar widget can now be set to iOS, Android(Dark) or Android(Light).

The following properties has been added:
* **widgetTheme**: either "iOS", "Android(Dark)" or "Android(Light)"
* **backgroundOpacity**: either "Opaque", "Translucent" or "Transparent"

The **opaqueBackground** property has been removed.  Use the
**backgroundOpacity** property instead.

The default theme is "iOS" and the background is opaque by default.
