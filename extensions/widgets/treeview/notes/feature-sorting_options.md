# Sorting Options

The tree view widget now has the ability to sort the keys of its **arrayData** in different ways.
Two properties have been added to achieve this:
* **sortOrder**: either "ascending" or "descending"
* **sortType**: either "text" or "numeric".

The default sort order of the widget is ascending numeric.
